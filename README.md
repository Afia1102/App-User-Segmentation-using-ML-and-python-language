In this ML internship project, we analyzed user behavior data to understand patterns in app usage and user retention. Using Python along with Pandas and NumPy libraries, we imported and processed the dataset, checking for null values and obtaining descriptive statistics. We then explored various aspects of user behavior, including screen time, spending on the app, ratings, and engagement metrics. Through data visualization using Plotly Express, we examined relationships between user behavior metrics and app status. Utilizing KMeans clustering for app user segmentation, we identified distinct user segments based on their behavior patterns. We found three segments: "Retained," "Churn," and "Needs Attention," indicating different levels of user engagement and retention. Finally, we visualized the segments using a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between last visited minutes and average spending on the app. This project employed Python for data analysis, Plotly Express for visualization, and KMeans clustering for segmentation, offering valuable insights into app user behavior and retention.
